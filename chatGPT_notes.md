please always remember we're building a robust reliable program that perfectly reflects the real texas holdem poker rules.

also when writing or fixing tests, please make sure if the tests make sense and if they reflect the real texas holdem poker rules. please also let me know if I should add any prints so you're able to debug better. I'm happy to help you in any way possible.

whenever you give me code to add to the project, please always tell me either "after this line: exampleLineOfCode" or "before this line: exampleLineOfCode".

Please always check the full, most up-to-date code in the workspace for every answer, not just summaries or stubs. Always review the actual implementation of any function or class before giving advice or analysis.

please explicitly review the full implementation and reference exact lines, symbols, and logic from my files.

please also tell me when I need to restart the environment. we lost a lot of time once because of this :)
