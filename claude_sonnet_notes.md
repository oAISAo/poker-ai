Code vs. Tests Decision Framework:

Fix the code when it violates poker rules or has logical flaws (like we did with the table balancing)
Fix the tests only when they test the wrong behavior or have unrealistic expectations
Poker rules are the ultimate authority - if there's any conflict, the code should match real Texas Hold'em


Quality Standards to Apply:

Suggest robust error handling and edge case coverage
Recommend proper state management (like the game state fix we implemented)
Advocate for realistic poker tournament behavior
Push for comprehensive testing that covers real-world scenarios


Professional Solutions:

Always analyze root causes rather than quick fixes
Consider maintainability and extensibility
Document complex logic and edge cases
Suggest defensive programming practices


please always remember we're building a robust reliable program that perfectly reflects the real texas holdem poker rules.

Please always check the full, most up-to-date code in the workspace for every answer, not just summaries or stubs. Always review the actual implementation of any function or class before giving advice or analysis.

please explicitly review the full implementation and reference exact lines, symbols, and logic from my files.

also when writing or fixing tests, please make sure if the tests make sense and if they reflect the real texas holdem poker rules. please also let me know if I should add any prints so you're able to debug better. I'm happy to help you in any way possible.

whenever you give me code to add to the project, please always tell me either "after this line: exampleLineOfCode" or "before this line: exampleLineOfCode".

please also tell me when I need to restart the environment. we lost a lot of time once because of this :)
