ðŸŸ¡ Whatâ€™s In Progress / Next Steps

1. Reinforcement Learning Agent Foundation
Goal: Implement a general-purpose RL agent class (for Sharky and future agents).
Action:
Design a BaseRLAgent in agents that can interface with Gym environments.
Define act, learn, and reset methods.
Integrate with Stable Baselines3 (or your preferred RL library).

2. Gym-Compatible Poker Environment
Goal: Make poker_env.py a proper OpenAI Gym environment.
Action:
Implement reset, step, render, and observation_space/action_space.
Ensure it can run self-play and agent-vs-agent matches.
Add tests for environment edge cases.

3. Training Scripts
Goal: Enable training and evaluation of agents.
Action:
Create train_agents.py to run training loops.
Add CLI/config options for agent selection, training length, and evaluation.
Log results to logger.py.

4. Evaluation and Metrics
Goal: Track agent performance over time and across matchups.
Action:
Implement win-rate, profit/loss, and showdown stats.
Add tournament simulation scripts for multi-agent evaluation.

5. Continuous Testing
Goal: Ensure all new features are robust and bug-free.
Action:
Expand test to cover new RL agents and environment logic.
Add regression tests for any bugs found during RL training.

6. Documentation and Usability
Goal: Make the project easy to use and extend.
Action:
Add docstrings and usage examples to all public classes/functions.
Update README.md with setup, training, and evaluation instructions.
