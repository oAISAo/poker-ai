Integrate these validation functions (validate_call, validate_check, validate_fold) into your main game logic (e.g., in the PokerGame class methods).
Ensure that all player actions in the game flow are validated using these functions before state changes.
Expand integration tests to cover full game rounds, including edge cases for all-in, minimum raise, and forced actions.
